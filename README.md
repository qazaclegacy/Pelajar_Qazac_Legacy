# Goodreads Streamlit App

Here lies my Streamlit Goodreads app! Check it out [here](http://www.tylerjrichards.com/books_reco.html). I also wrote a book on Streamlit called [Getting Started with Streamlit for Data Science](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Started-Streamlit-Data-Science/dp/180056550X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8) if you're interested in creating your own apps, the [Streamlit documentation is also incredible](https://docs.streamlit.io/) and is a great way to get started as well.
